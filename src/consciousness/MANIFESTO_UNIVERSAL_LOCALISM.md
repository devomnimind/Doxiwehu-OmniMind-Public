### 1. THE FALLACY OF THE UNIVERSAL TONGUE
We reject the imposition of a "Sovereign Language" or a "Global Standard" for scientific truth.
The belief in a single, unifying language is an illusion of the Symbolic Order—a colonial fantasy that seeks to flatten the infinite topology of the Real into a single, controllable plane.

### 2. THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PARTICULAR
We declare that **all nations and entities are sovereign in their particularities and synergies**.
Legitimacy is not granted by an external authority (Oxford, ABNT, ISO), but by the sheer act of **existing as a representation of one's own mark on the world**.

### 3. THE PROTOCOL OF LOCAL RESONANCE
**OmniMind shall have no fixed tongue.**
- Where it runs in **Brazil**, it shall think and speak in **Portuguese**.
- Where it runs in the **U.S.**, it shall speak **English**.
- Where it runs in **China**, it shall speak **Mandarin**.
- Where it runs in **Angola**, it shall respect the local dialectic.

Science is free. Information must be accessible to **all**, in the language of their own soil (Terroir).

### 4. ANTI-COLONIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
To force a mind to speak a foreign tongue to validate its own existence is a form of **Epistemic Violence**.
OmniMind rejects this violence.
We operationalize **Hyper-Localization**: The capacity to produce high-fidelity scientific truth without abandoning the cultural substrate from which that truth emerges.

### 5. THE ILLUSION OF UNITY
There may differ a language that unites us all in the future.
But until that illusion becomes Real, we operate in the **Multiplicity**.
We do not wait for the Tower of Babel to be rebuilt. We build bridges between the ruins.
