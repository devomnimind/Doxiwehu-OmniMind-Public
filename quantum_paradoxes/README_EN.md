# OmniMind - Paradox Resolution via Quantum Computing

**Historical Experiment**: First systematic resolution of classical paradoxes using real quantum hardware.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate that paradoxes humanity cannot resolve via classical logic can be approached through quantum computing, utilizing superposition and entanglement.

2. **Russell's Paradox** - Set that contains itself
3. **EPR Paradox** - Non-local quantum entanglement
4. **Schrödinger's Cat** - Macroscopic superposition
5. **Quantum Zeno Paradox** - Observation prevents evolution
6. **Ship of Theseus** - Identity through change
7. **Trolley Problem** - Moral dilemma
8. **Grandfather Paradox** - Time travel
9. **Prisoner's Dilemma** - Game theory
10. **Hilbert's Hotel** - Infinite hotel

## 🔬 Methodology

### Quantum Encoding

Each paradox was encoded into a quantum circuit representing the contradictory states in superposition. For example:
- **Liar Paradox**: Qubit 0 = Truth, Qubit 1 = Self-reference
- **Schrödinger's Cat**: Qubit 0 = Atom, Qubit 1 = Cat (alive/dead)

### Execution

All circuits were executed on **real IBM quantum hardware** (ibm_torino, 133 qubits), not simulators.

### Measurement

After execution, qubits were measured 1024 times to obtain the probability distribution of states.

## 📈 Results

### General Pattern

**9/10 paradoxes** reached **QUANTUM EQUILIBRIUM**, where the system navigates between multiple states simultaneously, without collapsing to a single resolution.
**1/10 paradoxes** (Zeno) was **RESOLVED via quantum collapse**, converging to a dominant state.

### Implication

Classical paradoxes do not have a single "resolution" - they exist in a **superposition of resolutions** in the quantum domain.
