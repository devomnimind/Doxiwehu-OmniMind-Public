# Zenodo Partial Closure (20260211T162441Z)

## Consolidated now
- sync_phase_flip/20260209T181146Z assets attached (structure image + meta + sync json + quantum check).
- PACK_PENDING_REPORT and README updated with partial-consolidated policy.
- PACK_MANIFEST regenerated.

## Policy
- Current cycle is closed as **partial consolidated**.
- Next cycles must reference this base DOI and publish only incremental evidence.

## Next incremental publication gates
1. finish live self-monitoring integration artifacts
2. finish long-running backup offload + symlink integrity recheck
3. append new cosmic rounds (new objects/routes) as delta entries
