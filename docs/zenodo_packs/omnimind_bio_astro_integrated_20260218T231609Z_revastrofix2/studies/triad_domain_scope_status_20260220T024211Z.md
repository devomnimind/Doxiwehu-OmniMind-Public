# Triad Domain Scope Status (20260220T024211Z)

This pack closes bio + astro + runtime diagnostics.

- Bio: present
- Astro: present
- Social: not materialized in this release (explicitly declared)

Rationale:
- keep v10 closure reproducible and bounded,
- avoid implicit claims for non-materialized social covariates,
- prepare social track as a separate follow-up artifact.
