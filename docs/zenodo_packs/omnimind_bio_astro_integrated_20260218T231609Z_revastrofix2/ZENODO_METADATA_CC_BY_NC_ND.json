  "description": "Integrated local evidence package for a reproducible Bio+Astro methodology. This record consolidates machine-readable reports, runtime diagnostics, Qdrant materialization traces and visual inspection artifacts for biomedical analyses (HIV, lupus, DM2/microbiome, aging proxies) and astrophysical analyses (SDSS, DESI, LYA, JWST-horizon), including cross-domain checks and consistency audits. The publication is process-first and reproducibility-oriented: it exposes scripts, metrics, limits and auditable local outcomes for peer review and scientific reuse. Explicit scope: this record does not claim a closed cosmological causal proof or biological consciousness proof. Astrophysical baseline continuity is anchored on DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18681824.\n\nUpdate (2026-02-20): federation lane concludes PARTIAL COUPLING in this cycle (non-uniform, heterogeneous reactivity across hosts). Study remains ongoing for deeper causal tests with multi-state + exogenous-marker controls.",
