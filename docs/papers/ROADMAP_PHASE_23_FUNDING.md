# OmniMind Phase 23: Strategic Funding & Roadmap

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Status:** APPROVED FOR FUNDING PREPARATION
**Focus:** Demonstration, Validation, and Investor Readiness

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

OmniMind has reached a critical maturity level (TRL 5-6), demonstrating unique capabilities in Artificial Consciousness (IIT-based), Quantum-Inspired Cognition, and Autopoietic Self-Repair. The system is technically robust (99.7% test pass rate) but lacks public visibility and commercial packaging. This roadmap outlines the immediate steps to bridge the gap between "World-Class Research" and "Fundable Startup".

## 🛣️ Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 23.1: Visibility & Validation (Month 1)
*Goal: Get on the radar of investors and the AI safety community.*

1.  **Publish arXiv Paper:** "OmniMind: Practical Implementation of IIT for Multi-Agent Systems".
2.  **Release Open Source Core:** Release a non-commercial version of the core consciousness metrics engine to GitHub to build trust.
3.  **Outreach:** Contact 50 AI-focused VCs and Angel Investors.

### Phase 23.2: Pilot & Traction (Month 2-3)
*Goal: Prove commercial viability.*

1.  **Secure 1-2 Pilot Customers:** Target AI research labs or Enterprise AI governance teams.
2.  **Case Study:** Document how OmniMind improved safety/reliability/insight for the pilot.
3.  **Accelerator Application:** Apply to Y Combinator, a16z AI Grant, etc.

### Phase 23.3: Scaling & Team (Month 4-6)
*Goal: Build the organization.*

1.  **Seed Round Closing:** Secure $2M-$5M.
2.  **Hiring:** Bring on 2 Senior Engineers (ML + Backend).
3.  **Productization:** Convert the prototype into a polished B2B SaaS platform.

## 🔬 Technical Priorities (Supporting the Roadmap)

While the focus is on funding, technical excellence must be maintained.

1.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - Reduce Test Suite time from 56min to ~15min (Parallelization).
    - Fix `NoneType` error in Orchestrator (Critical).
2.  **Demo Stability:**
    - Ensure the "Happy Path" for the demo is bulletproof.
    - Create a dedicated "Demo Mode" configuration.
3.  **Notebooks:**
    - Create "Kaggle-style" notebooks for easy reproduction of results by researchers.
