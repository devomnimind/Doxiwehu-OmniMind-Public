# ⚠️ WARNING: ARCHIVED / DEPRECATED CODE

**DO NOT USE SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY WITHOUT PRIOR VERIFICATION.**

This directory contains code that has been archived or deprecated. It is excluded from standard linting (`flake8`) and type-checking (`mypy`) to prevent noise in the development workflow.

## Restoration Protocol
If you intend to restore any script from this directory to operational status:

1.  **Move** the script to a proper active directory (e.g., `scripts/maintenance` or `scripts/utilities`).
2.  **Run Quality Checks** BEFORE execution:
    ```bash
    flake8 path/to/restored_script.py
    mypy path/to/restored_script.py
    ```
3.  **Refactor** code to meet current project standards (Python 3.12+, strict types).
4.  **Verify** functionality in a safe environment.
